# Stranger Things: The Game ðŸ‘¾ðŸ•¹
<div style="text-align: justify"> Strangers Things: The Game is a 8-bit retro game, inspired by the Stranger Things series, transports players back to the 1980s. The game features two mini-games: the first is a Minesweeper-like challenge, and the second is a Space Invader-type battle. To save Hawkins, players must successfully complete both mini-games. This project served as a final requirement for the CCS03 course (BSIT, Year 1) at Angeles University Foundation. </div>
